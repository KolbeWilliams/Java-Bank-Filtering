# Java-Bank-Filtering
This Java program randomly generates an array of banks, each with its interest rate and bank code. The program asks for an interest rate, loan amount, and loan term. It then filters the banks based on the user's criteria and creates a table of matching banks. The banks are sorted alphabetically by name and by interest rate at different points.
